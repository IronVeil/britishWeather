# How to contribute
Hey, you! If you want to contribute, feel free to do so. Open up an issue if theres a problem, or if you are feeling brave enough clone the repo and submit your own handy work. Just please no spam and try not to mess anything up with spagetti code.

## Setup
To create this website, I used:
- Latest version of VS Code
- Live SASS extension to compile SASS; set to compressed, no map file and saved in ` /src/css/*.min.css `

## Structure
- `src` is used to contain all the files needed. They are organised into subfolders accordingly, such as `js` for JavaScript, `css` for compiled CSS code, and `scss` for the SCSS files
- Comments are used to make things easier to read, although I need to add more

## Contact
If you need any further contact, open up an issue. I will drop my email address if appropriate.
