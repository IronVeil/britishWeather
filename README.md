# BritishWeather
BritishWeather is a minimal weather app based around the United Kingdom. You can check it out [here](https://britishweather.netlify.app)

## Functionality
It tells you:
- Current weather
- The temperature and what it feels like
- The humidity

I am planning on expanding it, see [here](https://github.com/IronVeil/weatherSite/projects/2) for more information.
